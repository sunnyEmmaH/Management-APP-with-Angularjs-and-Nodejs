This project is to develop a MEAN application (with nodeJS and MongoDB as backend) for employee directory. 
It should have following pages:
  1. Home Page - List of all employees:
    A list with name, picture, title, number of direct reports, and a few others (like the original user management);
    Other things: sorting, search, endless/infinite scrolling;
    When an employee is clicked, it goes to his/her details;
    There should be ADD button to add a new employee;
  2. Employee Details Page - Show details information about the employee:
    When manager is clicked, it goes to the manager's detail page;
    When Direct Reports is clicked, it goes to the direct report list page (below);
    When a contact is clicked, it makes calls or sends email;
    The employee information can be edited via a EDIT button and then SAVE;
    BACK button goes to the Home page;
  3. Direct Report List Page. something like:
    Shows direct reports name, picture, and his/her direct reports;
    When a direct report is clicked, it goes to that person's detail page;
    When BACK button is clicked, it goes to the original employee's detail page;
